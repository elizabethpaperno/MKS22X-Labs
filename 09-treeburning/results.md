### Why did you choose the board size for your finalized table?
### Why did you choose the number of repetitions size for your finalized table?
### What did your testing show about changing the board size?
### Knowing that there were differences based on boardsize, what was the relationship between the board size and the maximum burn time? How did you test this?
### What density of trees yields the maximum burn time?
Two tables include a header that tells the number of repetitions and board size chosen. The size/repetitions can be different
One table from 5% to 95% density in 5% intervals.
